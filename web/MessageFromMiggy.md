This is Next.js, a React web framework

You will be building the static assets of this app for viewing in the nodejs app that Ben built out for us.

# Caution
Make sure not to use any of the functions for "Server-side rendering"
They won't work in production as all of your app will be built into the public folder and served that way through express
